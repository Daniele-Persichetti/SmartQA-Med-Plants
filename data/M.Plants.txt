EFFECTS: Urinary antiseptic and astringent. Arbutin is hydrolyzed in the gut and then conjugated in the liver; in alkaline urine, it releases hydroquinone, which is antimicrobial. Used for urinary tract infections (UTIs), particularly cystitis. Astringent tannins also help soothe irritated tissues.
===USAGE===
METHODS: Dried leaves (infusion/tea, capsules, tincture, extract). Requires alkaline urine for optimal antiseptic effect (may need dietary changes or sodium bicarbonate - consult professional). Best used at first sign of UTI.
-
SIDE_EFFECTS: Hydroquinone can be irritating and potentially toxic in large doses or with prolonged use. Nausea and vomiting may occur, especially with strong teas or high doses. Not recommended for long-term use (generally max 1-2 weeks, max 5 times per year). Contraindicated in pregnancy, breastfeeding, kidney disease, and in children. Tannins can cause stomach upset.
